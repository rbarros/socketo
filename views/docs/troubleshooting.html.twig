                    <strong>Q:</strong> I followed the <a href="/docs/hello-world">Hello World!</a> tutorial and I got it
                    to work in telnet but couldn't get it working in any of the browsers.
                    <br><strong>A:</strong> <a href="/docs/hello-world#nextsteps">You missed a step</a>

                    <strong>Q:</strong> I'm using App and I get 404's when I try to connect.
                    <br><strong>A: </strong> Make sure the first parameter ($host) of App is the same hostname you use to connect in your JavaScript WebSocket connection.
                    If you need to support multiple hosts the fourth parameter of App::route() lets you specify an alternative $host to the default in __construct.

                    <strong>Q:</strong> I'm using App and I get 403's when I try to connect.
                    <br><strong>A:</strong> This is actually a security feature!
                    App, by default, enforces a same origin policy to prevent other websites from connecting to your server.
                    Either make sure you're opening WebSocket connections in JavaScript from the same URL as your $host in App
                    or to allow another Origin the third parameter of App::route() accepts an array of allowed origins.
